    <h2> News </h2>
    <h3>2022 Budget</h3>
    <br>During the last year, the OTW Finance team has continued its work of ensuring 
    that the organization's bills are paid, tax returns filed, and standard accounting procedures met. 
    The team also revamped the accounting Chart of Accounts to better reflect the OTW's financial activity. 
    Preparation for the 2021 audit of financial statements is currently ongoing!</br>


    <h3>March Newsletter, Volume 166</h3>
    <br>The Board of Directors, Elections, and Volunteers & Recruiting worked together in March to update the 
    eligibility requirements for future Board elections. Volunteers no longer have to hold a "staff" position to run 
    for Board: any volunteer who has served for 9 months in the past year is eligible. 
    You can read the full eligibility requirements on our website. </br>

    <h3>Five Things Julie Bozza said</h3>
    <br>Every month or so the OTW will be doing a Q&A with one of its volunteers about their experiences in the 
    organization. The posts express each volunteer's personal views and do not necessarily reflect the views of the 
    OTW or constitute OTW policy. Today's post is with Julie Bozza, who volunteers as an Open Doors administrative 
    volunteer. </br>
